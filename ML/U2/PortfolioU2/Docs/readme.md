## 📝 **Project Description**

This project undertakes a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis to explore the intricate relationship between cryptocurrency market volatility and global public interest. The primary objective is to determine if patterns in public curiosity, as measured by Google Search Trends, correlate with or predict fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market. The analysis leverages time-series statistical methods to uncover temporal dependencies and geospatial visualization techniques to map the geographical distribution of interest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The core of this investigation is documented in the `03_spatiotemporal_analysis_fixed.ipynb` notebook, which provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the data processing, analysis, and visualization workflow.

## 📁 **Project Structure**

The project is organized into a main analysis notebook and a dedicated data directory. This structure ensures a clean separation between the code and the data, facilitating reproducibility and clarity.

## 🎯 **Analysis Goals & Workflow**

The main goal of this analysis is to answer the following questions:

1.  Is there evidence of **volatility clustering** in the cryptocurrency market?
2.  Is there a statistically significant **correlation** between public search interest and market volatility?
3.  What is the **global distribution** of public interest in cryptocurrencies?

The following section details the progress and evidence for each analytical step.

### **Progress and Evidence**

#### 1\. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing

  * **Description:** The initial step involved loading two primary datasets: historical daily price data for cryptocurrencies and Google Trends data for related search terms. The financial data was processed to calculate daily returns. These returns were then squared to serve as a proxy for daily volatility, a standard practice in financial econometrics. The Google Trends data was cleaned and chronologically aligned with the price data for subsequent correlation analysis.
  * **Evidence:** Initial dataframes loaded and prepared for analysis within the notebook.
  * **Tools/Files:**
      * **Notebook:** `03_spatiotemporal_analysis_fixed.ipynb`
      * **Input Data:** `data/sample_temporal.csv`, `data/trends_fixed.csv`

#### 2\. Temporal Analysis: Volatility Clustering with Autocorrelation

  * **Description:** To investigate the presence of volatility clustering, we computed the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) on the squared returns. The ACF plot visualizes the correlation of the time series with its own past values. A slowly decaying ACF plot is a strong indicator of volatility clustering. Our analysis confirmed this phenomenon, revealing a persistent, slowly decaying autocorrelation structure.
  * **Evidence:** The Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plot for the squared returns, showing significant correlation at multiple lags.

  * **Tools/Files:**
      * **Notebook:** `03_spatiotemporal_analysis_fixed.ipynb`
      * **Output Data:** `data/acf_returns_squared.json`

#### 3\. Temporal Analysis: Cross-Correlation with Google Trends

  * **Description:** We employed the Cross-Correlation Function (CCF) to measure the relationship between our two time series: market volatility and Google Search interest. The CCF plot helps identify if one series leads or lags the other. The analysis revealed a statistically significant correlation between the two, suggesting that spikes in public interest often coincide with or precede periods of high market turbulence.
  * **Evidence:** The Cross-Correlation Function (CCF) plot illustrating the correlation between volatility and search trends at various time lags.
  * **Tools/Files:**
      * **Notebook:** `03_spatiotemporal_analysis_fixed.ipynb`
      * **Output Data:** `data/ccf_full.json`, `data/correlation.json`

#### 4\. Spatiotemporal Analysis: Geographic Interest Distribution

  * **Description:** To add a spatial dimension, we aggregated Google Trends data by country to measure relative search interest globally and generated a choropleth world map. This visualization provides an intuitive understanding of which regions are hotspots of cryptocurrency interest. The map revealed high levels of interest in countries across South America, Africa, and Eastern Europe, highlighting the global nature of the cryptocurrency phenomenon.
  * **Evidence:** A choropleth world map displaying the geographical distribution of search interest.
  * **Tools/Files:**
      * **Notebook:** `03_spatiotemporal_analysis_fixed.ipynb`
      * **Output Data:** `data/interests.json`, `data/map_data.csv`

## Additional Notebook — Hierarchical analysis: Supply risk (Terra Cotta Foods)

This repository also includes an additional notebook that complements the spatiotemporal analysis: a hierarchical, country-level study developed to evaluate supply risk and expansion strategy for Terra Cotta Foods (TCF).

- Notebook: `01_hierarchical_analysis.ipynb`
- Purpose: shortlist candidate countries in Latin America and Asia by "Total GDP" (GDP per capita × population), produce hierarchical visualizations (dendrogram, treemap, sunburst, Sankey, comparative charts), and propose tactical labor & budget reallocations to enable incremental expansion.
- Key input: `data/01_gdp_population.csv`
- Key outputs (exported JSON artifacts for dashboard integration):
  - `data/organization.json`
  - `data/budget.json`
  - `data/countries.json`
  - `data/asia_latam.json`
  - `data/top10_asia_latam.json`
  - `data/job_rellocation.json`
  - `data/budget_rellocation.json`

Main methods & visuals
- Data enrichment: continent mapping via country_converter and a custom region mapping that isolates Latin America.
- Metrics: computed Total GDP and per-continent correlations (Population, GDP per capita, Total GDP) to evaluate market scale vs. purchasing power.
- Clustering: geographic proximity clustering (Ward linkage on lat/lon) used to build a dendrogram for hub/cluster planning.
- Hierarchical visuals:
  - Interactive treemap (Region → Country) — size = Total GDP, color = GDP per capita.
  - Sunburst — organizational headcount distribution.
  - Dendrogram — proximity clusters for regional hub candidates.
  - Scatter/bubble — Population vs GDP per capita, bubble size = Total GDP.
  - Sankey — proposed budget reallocation flows into expansion investments.
- Exports: dataframes converted to JSON to feed a web dashboard (see listed output files).

Quick run instructions (Windows)
1. Open the repository folder in a terminal (PowerShell or CMD) and create/activate a venv:
    - python -m venv venv
    - venv\Scripts\activate
2. Install required packages (not exhaustive; see notebook imports):
    - pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly country_converter scipy squarify
3. Launch Jupyter and run the hierarchical notebook:
    - jupyter notebook
    - Open `01_hierarchical_analysis.ipynb` and run cells top-to-bottom.

Notes and caveats
- Total GDP is used as a first-order proxy for market & production potential; final site selection requires supplier, logistics cost, political risk, labor market, and regulatory analysis.
- Interactive Plotly figures require a browser-capable environment; static PNG exports can be produced if needed.
